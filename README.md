The Trespasser Mod Manager (TMM) performs the following functions:
* Reads the tp_mod.ini to determine the Active Mod
* Checks the contents of the /mods/ directory to generate a list of available mods
* When prompted by the user, edits the tp_mod.ini to change the Active Mod
* When prompted by the user, launches Trespasser CE
