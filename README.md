# Trespasser Mod Manager (TMM)
The GUI-based utility for managing Trespasser mods.

TMM simplifies the process of toggling the active mod in Trespasser by providing a GUI and removing the need to manually edit config files.

The Trespasser Mod Manager (TMM) performs the following functions:
* Reads the tp_mod.ini to determine the ```activefm``` (Active Mod)
* Reads the tp_mod.ini to determine the ```fmpath``` (Mod Directory)
* Checks the contents of the ```fmpath``` directory to generate a list of available mods
* When prompted by the user, edits the tp_mod.ini to change the Active Mod
* When prompted by the user, launches Trespasser CE
